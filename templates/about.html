<h1>About</h1>
</header>

<p>The OpenShift Origin index is the place to find and browse OpenShift 
Community-sourced QuickStarts and Cartridges.</p>
<p>The OpenShift Origin index is a complimentary service for users of OpenShift Origin-based services such as OpenShift Online.</p>
<p>OpenShift and the OpenShift Origin Index are Red Hat sponsored Community projects.</p>


<p>The Index is here to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover new QuickStarts and Cartridges.</li>
<li>Add your QuickStarts and Cartridges from your projects on Github.</li>
<li>Socially share the ones you are currently enjoying with your friends!</li>
<li>Give Feedback directly to the authors on their projects.</li>
<li>Contribute and Collaborate on existing projects instead of re-inventing the wheel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code for this Open Source project is available here</p>
<p>The Index is still a work in progress, so if you don't find what you are looking for, feel free to contact us or post an issue in our github repo here</p>
